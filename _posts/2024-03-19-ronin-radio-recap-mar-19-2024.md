Title: Ronin Radio goes through TSA..


Axie Doll purchase:
It was recently announced that Sky Mavis co-founder Jihoz stepped in to purchase Axie DoLL, a community-built game that had garnered a significant following. This move was made to prevent the game from shutting down, although the details of the purchase, including the amount and future plans, were not disclosed. Axie DoLL was particularly appreciated for its accessible gameplay, which provided an enjoyable experience without requiring players to dive deep into the game's meta. With Sky Mavis's acquisition, Axie DoLL could potentially become a significant entry point for newcomers to the Ronin blockchain gaming environment. The community is hopeful this revival will inject fresh life into the game, with some speculating about AXP integrations and added utility in the future.

Kaidro Journal NFTs:
During the discussion about Kaidro Journals NFTs, the hosts touched upon an exploit that was discovered post-mint, which allowed individuals to check the rarity of an unrevealed journal on the marketplace. This exploit was significant because it enabled people to selectively purchase unrevealed journals of higher rarity, particularly targeting those classified under the 'Gaia' category. The hosts expressed concern over this issue and mentioned that they had informed the relevant parties so that the exploit could be addressed. There was a sense of urgency in their tone, highlighting the need for a patch to ensure the integrity of the NFT collection and the fairness of the marketplace.

Apeiron Arena Awards:
The hosts of Ronin Radio were clearly excited about the recent announcement concerning Apeiron, particularly focusing on the $APRS leaderboard rewards. They highlighted that Apeiron is moving beyond just airdrops and will now be rewarding players directly with $APRS for their performance in the leaderboard standings. This update marks a significant shift in how rewards are distributed in the game and reflects the game's commitment to its play-to-earn model. The enthusiasm was palpable as they discussed the implications for the community and the added incentive for players to engage more competitively in Apeiron.

Axie Classics guild wars:
The hosts of Ronin Radio enthusiastically tackled the topic of the upcoming Axie Classics Guild Wars, an event that promises to bring the competitive spirit to the forefront of the Axie community. They explained that guild points could be accumulated by winning games in the Cursed Coliseum, with the points increasing progressively with each consecutive win. A guild vault support system was also highlighted, enabling members to contribute or lend their Axies to the guild, earning points whenever those Axies are used by another member. This system provides a unique opportunity for even those who may not be top players, such as breeders, to contribute significantly to their guild's success. They expressed excitement about the grand tournament's role in guild point accumulation, urging players without a guild to sign up as their participation becomes valuable for earning points. The discussion was wrapped up with a keen anticipation for the Guild Wars, set to start on the 22nd, and an impressive prize pool of up to $90,000 for the top-performing guilds, emphasizing the event's potential to be a thrilling and lucrative experience for all involved.
