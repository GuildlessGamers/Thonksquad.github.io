Title: Kaizen -> Kaidro ü§åüèΩ Big News for $Ron üëÄ

In this episode of the Ronin Radio, Gila and several guests including Peggy and Robert from Kaidro, Kathleen and Scott from Sky Mavis all discussed several exciting announcements and projects on the Ronin blockchain. 

Kaidro takes center stage:
The main highlight was the announcement of the Kaidro project, an anime and gaming IP launching on Ronin. Peggy and Robert introduced their IP Kaidro which includes a comic, anime, and game. They have been working on it for years and building a community around it.  The founders Peggy and Robert discussed their vision for Kaidro, they emphasized community involvement and storytelling across comics, games, the anime, and how they plan to gamify the entire IP.  The discussion highlighted the active involvement of the audience in the Kaidro project, particularly through contests where fans could dress up as characters or create their own, with selected entries being featured in the comic. This engagement strategy allowed fans to contribute creatively to the project by developing their characters and lore within the Kaidro universe.

The Kaidro conversation also touched upon the transition from web 2.0 to web 3.0 space, emphasizing the amplification of strategies learned from the previous space to enhance engagement and interaction within the Kaidro project. The incorporation of Web3 technology was seen as a crucial element in expanding the project's reach and creating a more immersive experience for the community.

Other Ronin topics:
-  Wild Forest mint sold out in under 10 minutes showing the hunger and demand from the Ronin community for new NFT projects. 
- $RON restaking feature is now available
- Apeiron highly undervalued but potentially the esports game of web3 this year.

TRR LIVE!
