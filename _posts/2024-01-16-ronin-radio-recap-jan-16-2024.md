The Ownership Narrative:

Vard has been an early supporter of the Pixel game for over two years. Although the game was initially simple, he saw the potential due to the developers' commitment to building the game. 

Squiddy works at Superfine, a user acquisition tool to help web3 games reach their target audience through traditional ad networks. 

Working in web3 is different as it's a 24/7 industry with people from all over the world. While it can be challenging, the ability to interact and work with people you never thought possible is rewarding.  Creators need to truly love what they do and be passionate to succeed in web3. While hard work is required, the fulfillment of creating something you love makes it worthwhile.

The Ronin ecosystem continues to grow through partnerships, the Mavis Store for in-game purchases, and AXP integrations into new games. Squiddy sees Ronin as one of the top players in web3 gaming with the games and team behind it.

Overall, the key takeaway is the importance of passion, community, and persistence in building within and supporting the growing web3 gaming space. The speakers share their experiences working for projects and how conviction in the potential of web3 gaming drove them to continue building.
