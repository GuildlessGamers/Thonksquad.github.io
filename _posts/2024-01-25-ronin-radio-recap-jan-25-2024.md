Some 'Homeland' Truths:

Jihoz and the Sky Mavis founders take responsibility for the poor launch of Homeland and acknowledge they did not meet community expectations. They promise short, medium, and long term solutions to address the issues.

Many community members criticize Homeland for not delivering the social and collaborative experience that was initially envisioned for land. They feel the current game strayed too far from the original vision. 

Gila and Jihoz lead a discussion about whether Homeland can be improved or if a new experience integrating concepts from Project T may be needed to fulfill the community's vision for land. It was made clear that Homeland would be stabilised and improved upon and not scrapped. 

Many Axie community members expressed frustration at the lack of communication and transparency from Sky Mavis during Homeland's development. Community member Schweet expressed his passion for the project and disappointment with not being heard after years of development and how "we" ended up here with such a poor experience. 

Suggestions were discussed around Pixels being what Homeland should have been and it was acknowledged. Having incentives and benefits for land owners and still access for an experience for free players.

While many are frustrated with the current state of Homeland, most believe Sky Mavis will eventually course correct and deliver a land experience that meets community expectations due to their desire to build something meaningful.
