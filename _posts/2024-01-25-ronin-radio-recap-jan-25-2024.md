Some 'Homeland' Truths:

Jihoz and the Sky Mavis founders take responsibility for the poor launch of Homeland and acknowledge they did not meet community expectations. They promise short, medium, and long term solutions to address the issues.

Many community members criticize Homeland for not delivering the social and collaborative experience that was initially envisioned for land. They feel the current game favors adventurers over landowners. 

Gila and Jihoz lead a discussion about whether Homeland can be improved or if a new experience integrating concepts from Project T may be needed to fulfill the community's vision for land.

Many Axie community members expressed frustration at the lack of communication and transparency from Sky Mavis during Homeland's development.  Jihoz acknowledges they lost focus and promised more involvement from the founders going forward.

Suggestions were discussed to increase alignment between landowners and free players by giving free players rewards for interacting with landowners' plots. Pixels is cited as an example of incentivizing both groups.

While many are frustrated with the current state of Homeland, most believe Sky Mavis will eventually course correct and deliver a land experience that meets community expectations due to their desire to build something meaningful and redeem their vision.
