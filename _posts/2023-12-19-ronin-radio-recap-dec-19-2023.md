After years of eager anticipation, part evolutions are finally making their way to Axie Infinity, promising a transformative experience for players and collectors alike. The brainchild of renowned designer Masamune, these evolutions aim to infuse axies with power progression and vertical growth.
Masamune's artistic vision takes center stage in the design of these part evolutions, as revealed in his recent  <a href="https://blog.axieinfinity.com/p/dear-lunacia">letter to the community</a>  that delves into the creative process. He emphasizes the importance of incorporating seemingly "ugly" parts to enhance the beauty of the overall design, adding depth and character to each axie.

At the core of this evolutionary system is AXP, a crucial component that translates time and effort into vertical progression for axies. This system is set to redefine the gameplay experience, providing utility in Origins gameplay before potentially making its way into Axie classic. Part Upgrades will both provide noticeable power boosts and add a new layer of strategy and excitement to the Axie Infinity universe.

To achieve maximum level, axies will require amounts substantial AXP and unwavering dedication from their owners. This not only showcases a player's commitment to Axie Infinity but also fosters a unique emotional attachment between owners and their axie companions.

Part evolutions are poised to bring about a paradigm shift in both the game dynamics and the economy. By introducing novel ways to burn tokens and level up axies, they offer a fresh avenue for engagement and progression. 

As part evolutions become a reality, Axie Infinity is poised for a groundbreaking chapter that could influence the broader landscape of the NFT space.  The potential impact extends beyond Axie Infinity, as part evolutions could serve as a blueprint for other NFT projects seeking to breathe new life into their collectibles. Collectors are eagerly anticipating the evolution of their favorite axies, though it's noted that starter axies may undergo relative nerf with the introduction of part evolutions as the starter axis had evolutions already.
