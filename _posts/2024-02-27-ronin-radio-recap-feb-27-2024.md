Title: The place to beâ€¦

Pixel's Pet Mint:
Gila and guests discussed the Pixel's Pet Mint event, including details about the minting process scheduled between midnight and 2 AM UTC. There was curiosity about the criteria for allocation, with several questions being raised on Twitter. One of the speakers also hinted at a giveaway of $PIXEL as a celebratory gesture for the occasion.

Jihoz Wallet Hack:
Jihoz's personal wallet was hacked, which led to a significant market impact when the funds were dumped. The incident, although unfortunate, was clarified to be isolated and not a result of any security issues with the Ronin chain. The community expressed support for Jihoz and emphasized the importance of resilience, moving forward, and continuing to build despite the setback. Suggestions were made for tighter security measures, such as using a hardware wallet like a Trezor, to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Ronin Gaming Partnerships:
Rather than focusing solely on front-facing marketing hype, Sky Mavis deliberately partners with teams that have already proven their concepts and have tangible products ready for deployment. This selective process aims to ensure that the partnerships contribute to the ecosystem's growth in a meaningful way. The emphasis is on quality over quantity, with a focus on providing the necessary support and attention to partners for long-term success. The caliber of teams currently partnered with Ronin reflects a commitment to building a strong foundation for future developments within the gaming industry.  There is speculation about potential partnerships with major gaming companies like Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft, highlighting Sky Mavis's white glove approach to partnerships and emphasis on quality.

Wildforest Mint:
The Wildforest Mint resulted in a wide mix of experiences. While there was significant demand and excitement surrounding the mint, there were also challenges faced during the process. Issues such as heavy demand causing system strain and delays were acknowledged. It was noted that this mint was unexpectedly hyped, leading to a learning experience for both teams involved. Despite the issues faced, the event managed to sell out successfully, indicating strong interest in the offerings. Both the Wildforest team and Sky Mavis expressed a commitment to learning from the experience and improving future minting processes for smoother operations.
