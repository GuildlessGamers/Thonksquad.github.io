Title: $PIXEL is here! + More games on $Ronin

$Pixels:
One of the main talking points was the distribution plan of Pixels, a newly launched token. While there were mixed opinions, some expressing concerns about the lack of communication before the launch, others argued that the ecosystem allocation of 34% was necessary for sustainability. The discussion sparked further debate on tokenomics and its impact on the Ronin ecosystem.

Community-Built Games and Ronin Realms:
The community also delved into the potential of community-built games like Ronin Realms, an MMO game developed by Berlin. Participants discussed the game's vision, development approach, and the importance of community engagement. The idea of empowering the community to create immersive experiences on Ronin was well-received.

New Game Announcements:
Excitement filled the discussion with the announcement of Fight League, a multi-game IP featuring an action RPG. The studio behind Fight League has a loyal fanbase, which has the potential to attract new users to the Ronin ecosystem. The introduction of new games to Ronin was seen as a positive step towards expanding its offerings.

Ronin's Strategy:
The community also explored Ronin's strategy of onboarding proven IPs and experimenting with community-driven games. This approach was seen as a more sustainable way to grow the ecosystem rather than solely chasing hype. Integrating NFTs into existing games and IPs was also discussed as a potential avenue for future growth.

Apeiron's PvP Season:
Lastly, the discussion touched upon Apeiron's PvP season, which was coming to an end. The competitive PvP gameplay was praised for its high skill expression and esports potential, adding another layer of excitement to the conversation.
