Title: Higher?

All things Ron:
The host and speakers discussed the current perception and challenges faced by the Ronin network's cryptocurrency, Ron. The conversation revealed a sense of urgency to expand the network's recognition beyond its current user base. Despite the Ronin network's considerable size and activity, there's an acknowledgment that Ron has yet to make significant waves in the wider Ethereum community. Speakers expressed a strategic need to break out of niche echo chambers and engage more actively with the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem to elevate Ron's visibility and adoption. This reflects a broader goal for the Ronin Network to enhance its market presence and attract interest from across the Ethereum landscape.

Gaming industry health:
The broader gaming industry's financial health seems to be a point of concern, with the conversation highlighting a period of contraction characterized by layoffs and strategic budget cuts. Companies within the sector appear to be critically evaluating their expenses, trimming what's considered to be non-essential 'fat' to streamline operations and sustain through less certain times. This cautious approach reflects the gaming industry's response to economic pressures, signaling a time of reassessment and recalibration for many gaming firms. This indicates an awareness of the need to adapt to maintain stability in a rapidly evolving market.

Business Development recruitment:
In the midst of the gaming industry's financial pruning, the consideration around business development recruitment is particularly forward-looking. Ideal candidates for these roles are seen as needing a unique blend of skills and perspectives. They should possess an eye for identifying promising gaming products and an understanding of the nuances of web3. Importantly, there's a preference for individuals who can bring fresh insights from outside the Ronin ecosystem. This suggests a strategic shift towards diversity of thought and experience, aiming to infuse new energy and broaden the network's appeal. The conversation points to the value of external hires who can contribute a different 'flavor' and leverage connections within the broader gaming industry, rather than focusing on community insiders.

Gaming experience on Ronin:
The exchange surrounding experiences playing games on the Ronin network, particularly Apeiron and Wild Forest, emphasizes their entertainment value and potential within the gaming community. Comparisons with successful web3 games, like Wildcard, suggest that Apeiron could follow a similar trajectory, especially with its competitive gameplay that might appeal to both casual gamers and those interested in eSports. Moreover, the speakers mentioned Apeiron issuing its own token, presenting an attractive prospect for speculative investment within the Ronin ecosystem. For Wild Forest, there’s confidence that it could perform well even outside of the crypto gaming context, with its quality being a strong selling point. There’s a hint of optimism that with the right promotion and development, these games could bridge the gap to a wider audience, resonating with players used to high-budget titles in traditional gaming platforms.

Crypto gaming industry:
The observations around the crypto gaming industry reflect a keen awareness of the challenges in creating games that are both engaging and capable of capturing significant attention. There's a sentiment of impatience, as the industry has promised exciting games for some time, yet few have delivered experiences compelling enough to excite the mainstream gaming audience. The discussion underscores the difficulty in developing crypto games that stand out, emphasizing the importance of producing high-quality games that resonate with players and can compete with traditional gaming titles. The aspiration is that with the right blend of gameplay, innovation, and marketing, crypto games can overcome current hurdles and attract a broader player base, thereby cementing their place in the competitive gaming market.

Evaluating Ronin Network Games:
The exchange around current games on the Ronin network, such as Kaidro, conveys a sense of expectation versus reality. While there is a level of admiration for the hard work and maintenance that goes into developing web3 games, there's also an acknowledgment that games like Kaidro may not be meeting the high expectations set by the community. The sentiment is that, while these games are a step in the right direction, there's room for improvement to truly wow players. The importance of enhancing these games is underscored, as they play a critical role in attracting and retaining users within the Ronin ecosystem. There is a call for games that not only demonstrate the unique capabilities of crypto integration but also compete with the polish and appeal of mainstream video games.
